                                            <h3>Chicken Handi</h3>
                                            <center><img src = https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wyxwsp1486979827.jpg></img></center>
                                            <p>Chicken - 1.2 kg; Onion - 5 thinly sliced; Tomatoes - 2 finely chopped; Garlic - 8 cloves chopped; Ginger paste - 1 tbsp; Vegetable oil - ¼ cup; Cumin seeds - 2 tsp; Coriander seeds - 3 tsp; Turmeric powder - 1 tsp; Chilli powder - 1 tsp; Green chilli - 2; Yogurt - 1 cup; Cream - ¾ cup; fenugreek - 3 tsp Dried; Garam masala - 1 tsp; Salt - To taste</p>
                                            <p>Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil in it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden brown. Then take them out on a plate and set aside.
To the same pot, add the chopped garlic and sauté for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes and cook until tomatoes turn soft. This would take about 5 minutes.
Then return the fried onion to the pot and stir. Add ginger paste and sauté well.
Now add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies. Give them a quick stir.
Next goes in the spices – turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Sauté the spices well for couple of minutes.
Add the chicken pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. This would take about 15 minutes. Slowly sautéing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.
When the oil separates from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the yogurt doesn’t split. Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of the dried fenugreek leaves. Mix well.
Finally add the cream and give a final mix to combine everything well.
Sprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and garam masala and serve the chicken handi hot with naan or rotis. Enjoy!</p>

                                            <p>Add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake and sugar to a bowl and whisk to combine. Add the chicken, then stir to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Add 1 inch of vegetable oil to a heavy bottomed pot and heat until the oil reaches 360 degrees F. Line a wire rack with 2 sheets of paper towels and get your tongs out. Put the potato starch in a bowl

Fry the karaage in batches until the exterior is a medium brown and the chicken is cooked through. Transfer the fried chicken to the paper towel lined rack.

                                            <p>Chicken - 1.5kg; Butter - 25g; Olive Oil - 6 tblsp; Red Onions - 2 sliced; Red Pepper - 3 Large; Chorizo - 130g; Sun-Dried Tomatoes - 8; Garlic - 6 cloves sliced; Basmati Rice - 300g; Tomato Puree - drizzle; Paprika - ½ tsp; Bay Leaves - 4; Thyme - Handful; Chicken Stock - 350ml; Dry White Wine - 180g; Lemons - 2; Black Olives - 100g ; Salt - to serve; Pepper - to serve</p>
                                            <p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas mark 4. Have the chicken joints ready to cook. Heat the butter and 3 tbsp olive oil in a flameproof casserole or large frying pan. Brown the chicken pieces in batches on both sides, seasoning them with salt and pepper as you go. Don't crowd the pan - fry the chicken in small batches, removing the pieces to kitchen paper as they are done.

Add a little more olive oil to the casserole and fry the onions over a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned. Add the rest of the oil, then the peppers and cook for another 5 minutes.

Add the chorizo, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the rice, stirring to ensure it is well coated in the oil. Stir in the tomato paste, paprika, bay leaves and chopped thyme. Pour in the stock and wine. When the liquid starts to bubble, turn the heat down to a gentle simmer. Press the rice down into the liquid if it isn't already submerged and place the chicken on top. Add the lemon wedges and olives around the chicken.

Cover and cook in the oven for 50 minutes. The rice should be cooked but still have some bite, and the chicken should have juices that run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a knife. If not, cook for another 5 minutes and check again.</p>

                                            <p>chicken breast - 4 pounded to 1cm thickness; plain flour - 2 tablespoons; egg - 1 beaten; breadcrumbs - 100g fine; vegetable oil - 230ml frying; sunflower oil - 2 tablespoons; onions - 2 sliced; garlic - 5 chopped cloves; carrot - 2 sliced; plain flour - 2 tablespoons; curry powder - 4 teaspoons; chicken stock - 600ml; honey - 2 teaspoons; soy sauce - 4 teaspoons; bay leaf - 1; garam masala - 1 teaspoon</p>

For the curry sauce: Heat oil in medium non-stick saucepan, add onion and garlic and cook until softened. Stir in carrots and cook over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes.
Add flour and curry powder; cook for 1 minute. Gradually stir in stock until combined; add honey, soy sauce and bay leaf. Slowly bring to the boil.
Turn down heat and simmer for 20 minutes or until sauce thickens but is still of pouring consistency. Stir in garam masala. Pour the curry sauce through a sieve; return to saucepan and keep on low heat until ready to serve.
For the chicken: Season both sides of chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place flour, egg and breadcrumbs in separate bowls and arrange in a row. Coat the chicken breasts in flour, then dip them into the egg, then coat in breadcrumbs, making sure you cover both sides.
Heat oil in large frying pan over medium-high heat. Place chicken into hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 3 or 4 minutes each side. Once cooked, place on kitchen paper to absorb excess oil.
Pour curry sauce over chicken, serve with white rice and enjoy!</p>

                                            <p>Chicken - 1 whole; Oil - 2 quarts neutral frying; Egg White - 1; Flour - 1 1/2 cups ; Brown Sugar - 1 tablespoon; Salt - 1 tablespoon; paprika - 1 tablespoon; onion salt - 2 teaspoons; chili powder - 1 teaspoon; black pepper - 1 teaspoon; celery salt - 1/2 teaspoon; sage - 1/2 teaspoon; garlic powder - 1/2 teaspoon; allspice - 1/2 teaspoon; oregano - 1/2 teaspoon; basil - 1/2 teaspoon; marjoram - 1/2 teaspoon</p>
                                            <p>Preheat fryer to 350°F. Thoroughly mix together all the spice mix ingredients.
Combine spice mix with flour, brown sugar and salt.
Dip chicken pieces in egg white to lightly coat them, then transfer to flour mixture. Turn a few times and make sure the flour mix is really stuck to the chicken. Repeat with all the chicken pieces.
Let chicken pieces rest for 5 minutes so crust has a chance to dry a bit.
Fry chicken in batches. Breasts and wings should take 12-14 minutes, and legs and thighs will need a few more minutes. Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F.
Let chicken drain on a few paper towels when it comes out of the fryer. Serve hot.</p>

                                            <h3>Chicken Ham and Leek Pie</h3>
                                            <center><img src = https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/xrrtss1511555269.jpg></img></center>
                                            <p>Chicken Stock - 450ml; Chicken Breast - 3; Butter - 75g; Leek - 2 sliced; Garlic - 2 cloves minced; Plain Flour - 50g; Milk - 200ml; White Wine - 3 tbs; Double Cream - 150ml; Ham - 150g; Sea Salt - spinkling; Pepper - pinch; Plain Flour - 350g; Butter - 200g; Free-range Egg, Beaten - 1; Cold Water - 1 tbls; Free-range Egg, Beaten - 1</p>
                                            <p>Heat the chicken stock in a lidded saucepan. Add the chicken breast and bring to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken breasts from the water with tongs and place on a plate. Pour the cooking liquor into a large jug.
Melt 25g/1oz of the butter in a large heavy-based saucepan over a low heat. Stir in the leeks and fry gently for two minutes, stirring occasionally until just softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further minute. Add the remaining butter and stir in the flour as soon as the butter has melted. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
Slowly pour the milk into the pan, just a little at a time, stirring well between each adding. Gradually add 250ml/10fl oz of the reserved stock and the wine, if using, stirring until the sauce is smooth and thickened slightly. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes.
Season the mixture, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the cream. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface of the sauce with cling ilm to prevent a skin forming. Set aside to cool.
Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put a baking tray in the oven to heat.
For the pastry, put the flour and butter in a food processor and blend on the pulse setting until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. With the motor running, add the beaten egg and water and blend until the mixture forms a ball. Portion off 250g/10oz of pastry for the lid.
Roll the remaining pastry out on a lightly floured surface, turning the pastry frequently until around 5mm/¼in thick and 4cm/1½in larger than the pie dish. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and place it gently into the pie dish. Press the pastry firmly up the sides, making sure there are no air bubbles. Leave the excess pastry overhanging the sides.
Cut the chicken breasts into 3cm/1¼in pieces. Stir the chicken, ham and leeks into the cooled sauce. Pour the chicken filling into the pie dish. Brush the rim of the dish with beaten egg. Roll out the reserved pastry for the lid.
Cover the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. Trim any excess pastry.
Make a small hole in the centre of the pie with the tip of a knife. Glaze the top of the pie with beaten egg. Bake on the preheated tray in the centre of the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the pie is golden-brown all over and the filling is piping hot.</p>

                                            <h3>Chicken Alfredo Primavera</h3>
                                            <center><img src = https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/syqypv1486981727.jpg></img></center>
                                            <p>Butter - 2 tablespoons; Olive Oil - 3 tablespoons; Chicken - 5 boneless; Salt - 1 teaspoon; Squash - 1 cut into 1/2-inch cubes; Broccoli - 1 Head chopped; mushrooms - 8-ounce sliced; Pepper - 1 red; onion - 1 chopped; garlic - 3 cloves; red pepper flakes - 1/2 teaspoon; white wine - 1/2 cup; milk - 1/2 cup; heavy cream - 1/2 cup; Parmesan cheese - 1 cup grated; bowtie pasta - 16 ounces; Salt - pinch; Pepper - pinch ; Parsley - chopped</p>
                                            <p>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season both sides of each chicken breast with seasoned salt and a pinch of pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.  While the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the boiling water with a few generous pinches of kosher salt. Add the pasta and give it a stir. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of  pasta water before draining the pasta.  Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board; allow it to rest. Turn the heat down to medium and dd the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and olive oil to the same pan you used to cook the chicken. Add the veggies (minus the garlic) and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir to coat with the oil and butter (refrain from seasoning with salt until the veggies are finished browning). Cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Continue to cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the milk, heavy cream, and reserved pasta water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and allow to simmer and reduce for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan cheese and cooked pasta. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired. </p>

                                            <h3>Chicken & mushroom Hotpot</h3>
                                            <center><img src = https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/uuuspp1511297945.jpg></img></center>
                                            <p>Butter - 50g; Onion - 1 chopped; Mushrooms - 100g ; Plain Flour - 40g; Chicken Stock Cube - 1; Nutmeg - pinch; Mustard Powder - pinch; Chicken - 250g; Sweetcorn - 2 Handfuls; Potatoes - 2 large; Butter - 1 knob</p>
                                            <p>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the butter in a medium-size saucepan and place over a medium heat. Add the onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. Add the mushrooms to the saucepan with the onions.

Once the onion and mushrooms are almost cooked, stir in the flour – this will make a thick paste called a roux. If you are using a stock cube, crumble the cube into the roux now and stir well. Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously for 2 mins – this will cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury taste.

Take the roux off the heat. Slowly add the fresh stock, if using, or pour in 500ml water if you’ve used a stock cube, stirring all the time. Once all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and mustard powder. Put the saucepan back onto a medium heat and slowly bring it to the boil, stirring all the time. Once the sauce has thickened, place on a very low heat. Add the cooked chicken and vegetables to the sauce and stir well. Grease a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little butter and pour in the chicken and mushroom filling.

Carefully lay the potatoes on top of the hot-pot filling, overlapping them slightly, almost like a pie top.

Brush the potatoes with a little melted butter and cook in the oven for about 35 mins. The hot-pot is ready once the potatoes are cooked and golden brown.</p>

                                            <p>soy sauce - 3/4 cup; water - 1/2 cup; brown sugar - 1/4 cup; ground ginger - 1/2 teaspoon; minced garlic - 1/2 teaspoon; cornstarch - 4 Tablespoons; chicken breasts - 2; stir-fry vegetables - 1 (12 oz.); brown rice - 3 cups</p>

Gently toss everything together in the casserole dish until combined. Return to oven and cook 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving. Drizzle each serving with remaining sauce. Enjoy!</p>

                                            <p>Potatoes - 800g; Onions - 3; Olive Oil - 2 tblsp; Chicken Stock - 100ml; Creme Fraiche - 1 pot; Parmesan - Topping; Chicken Breasts - 4; Bacon - 4; Spinach - Topping; Peas - Topping</p>
                                            <p>15 minute potato gratin with chicken and bacon greens: a gratin always seems more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn't have to take 45mins, it's nice for a change and you can control the calorie content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche. (It's always tastes better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potatoes, finely slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 mins till firmish, not soft. Finely slice 3 onions and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml of chicken stock. Cook till the onions are soft then drain the potatoes and pour onto the onions. Season and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all is covered but not swimming. Grate Parmesan over the top then finish under the grill till nicely golden. serve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.</p>

                                            <h3>Chicken Enchilada Casserole</h3>
                                            <center><img src = https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/qtuwxu1468233098.jpg></img></center>
                                            <p>Enchilada sauce - 14 oz jar; shredded Monterey Jack cheese - 3 Cups; corn tortillas - 6; chicken breasts - 2</p>
                                            <p>Cut each chicken breast in about 3 pieces, so that it cooks faster and put it in a small pot. Pour Enchilada sauce over it and cook covered on low to medium heat until chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. No water is needed, the chicken will cook in the Enchilada sauce. Make sure you stir occasionally so that it doesn't stick to the bottom.
Remove chicken from the pot and shred with two forks.
Preheat oven to 375 F degrees.
Start layering the casserole. Start with about ¼ cup of the leftover Enchilada sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. I used a longer baking dish, so that I can put 2 corn tortillas across. Place 2 tortillas on the bottom, top with ⅓ of the chicken and ⅓ of the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with ⅓ of the cheese and repeat starting with 2 more tortillas, then chicken, sauce, cheese. Repeat with last layer with the remaining ingredients, tortillas, chicken, sauce and cheese.
Bake for 20 to 30 minutes uncovered, until bubbly and cheese has melted and started to brown on top.
Serve warm.</p>

                                            <p>Chicken Breasts - 4 - 6; Vinaigrette Dressing - 1 bottle; Cumin - 1½ tablespoon; Smoked Paprika - 1 tablespoon; Garlic - 1 teaspoon; Refried Beans - 1 can; Hard Taco Shells - 12; Shredded Mexican Cheese - 2 cups; Grape Tomatoes - Halved; Jalapeno - Sliced and Seeded; Avocado - Peeled and Sliced; Green Salsa - 2 tablespoons; Sour Cream - 3 tablespoons; Milk - 1 tablespoon</p>
                                            <p>Put the uncooked chicken breasts in the crock pot. Pour the full bottle of salad dressing over the chicken. Sprinkle the rest of the ingredients over the top and mix them in a bit with a spoon.
Cover your crock pot with the lid and cook on high for 4 hours.
Remove all the chicken breasts from the crock pot and let cool.
Shred the chicken breasts and move to a glass bowl.
Pour most of the liquid over the shredded chicken.
FOR THE TACOS:
Make the guacamole sauce by mixing the avocado and green salsa together. Pour the guacamole mixture through a strainer until smooth and transfer to a squeeze bottle. Cut the tip off the lid of the squeeze bottle to make the opening more wide if needed.
Make the sour cream sauce by mixing the sour cream and milk together until you get a more liquid sour cream sauce. Transfer to a squeeze bottle.
In a 9x 13 glass baking dish, fill all 12+ tacos with a layer of refried beans, cooked chicken and shredded cheese.
Bake at 450 for 10-15 minutes just until the cheese is melted and bubbling.
Out of the oven top all the tacos with the sliced grape tomaotes, jalapeno and cilantro.
Finish with a drizzle of guacamole and sour cream.
Enjoy!</p>

                                            <h3>Jerk chicken with rice & peas</h3>
                                            <center><img src = https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/tytyxu1515363282.jpg></img></center>
                                            <p>Chicken Thighs - 12; Lime - 1/2 ; Spring Onions - 1  bunch; Ginger - 1 tbs chopped; Garlic - 3 cloves; Onion - 1/2 ; Red Chilli - 3 chopped; Thyme - 1/2 teaspoon; Lime - Juice of 1; Soy Sauce - 2 tbs; Vegetable Oil - 2 tbs; Brown Sugar - 3 tbs; Allspice - 1 tbs; Basmati Rice - 200g; Coconut Milk - 400g; Spring Onions - 1  bunch; Thyme - 2 sprigs; Garlic - 2 cloves chopped; Allspice - 1 tbs</p>
                                            <p>To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée. If you’re having trouble getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up – don’t be tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.

Taste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well balanced.

Make a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.

If you want to barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you’re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45 mins until tender and cooked through.

While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for 10 mins.

Add the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if you like it really spicy.</p>
